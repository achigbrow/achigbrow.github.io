# Simple | Efficient | User Focus

I am a budding developer, user advocate, and a QA Analyst by trade. I believe that everything we build should be simple to use, elegant, and useful. I am currently a student in the CNM Java/Android Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp. I will be attending UNM to complete  the pre-requisites for the Masters in Computer Science program.
