# Simple, efficient, and user-focused 

I am a trainer and user advocate at heart and a Quality Assurance Analyst by trade. I believe that everything we build should be simple to use, elegant, and useful. I am currently a student at UNM working through the pre-requisites for the Masters in Computer Science program.
